# About Me

Welcome! My name is Zheng Yu, and I am currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence for Biomedicine and Healthcare at University College London (UCL). My academic and professional journey is driven by a deep passion for leveraging AI to tackle critical challenges in healthcare, particularly in the fight against cancer.

I am fortunate to have been advised by Professor [Archer Yi Yang](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/) during my undergraduate studies at McGill University. I really appreciate his help and still remain closely after my graduation.

My work focuses on developing and applying advanced AI methodologies, such as multimodal learning and generative models, to enhance disease prediction and diagnosis. I aspire to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and its real-world impact on medicine and healthcare.

Feel free to explore my projects, publications, and experiences showcased here, and don't hesitate to connect with me for collaboration or to discuss exciting ideas!
