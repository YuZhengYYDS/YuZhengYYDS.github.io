Welcome to my web corner! I’m Zheng Yu, an current MSc student specializing in Artificial Intelligence for Biomedicine and Healthcare at University College London. I graduated from McGill University with a First Class Honour in Computer Science. My academic and professional path reflects a deep-seated passion for harnessing AI to address some of the most pressing challenges in healthcare, with a particular focus on advancing the fight against cancer.

During my undergraduate studies at McGill University, I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor [Archer Yi Yang](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/), whose guidance has been invaluable. I’m deeply grateful for his support and we continue to remain closely as friend even after graduating.

Feel free to explore my projects, publications, and experiences shared here. I’d love to connect, collaborate, or discuss innovative ideas. Please feel free to contact me if you find me as a good match!
