## Projects  
### Handwritten Digit Recognition with CustomMLP  
*Developer | Sep. 2023 - Present*  
- Developed a high-performance Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch using only NumPy, focusing on handwritten digit recognition (MNIST).  
- Implemented a robust stochastic gradient descent (SGD) learning algorithm, enabling efficient training of a feedforward neural network.  
- Engineered a complete backpropagation mechanism using low-level NumPy operations.  

### Chest X-ray Classification for Pneumonia Detection  
*Developer | Oct. 2024*  
- Developed a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images into "NORMAL" and "PNEUMONIA" classes, achieving a validation accuracy of 95.72%.  
- Improved the model using Batch Normalization, Dropout, and Weight Initialization techniques to address overfitting.  
- Utilized a WeightedRandomSampler to balance the dataset and ensure fair representation during training.  
- Visualized and analyzed training progress using Weights and Biases (wandb).  

### Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Eye Fundus Images  
*Kaggle Participant | Nov. 2024*  
- Participated in the APTOS Blindness Detection Kaggle competition to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images.  
- Built a CNN architecture combining custom and pretrained models like EfficientNet and ResNet.  
- Experimented with advanced learning rate scheduling techniques using CosineAnnealingLR in PyTorch.
